        SERIOUS SAM ALPHA KARNAK BUT FROM THE TIANGUIS

IMPORTANT!!!1: If some parts of the campaign are laggy, i
recommend you to set r_dynamic 1, to 0

History: Mental's forces have rushed trough the Karnak temple to
take control over it and kill all the enemy force in their way 
(basically, bad guys killed good guys, you are good guy, kill bad)

The mission is very simple and lifeless, all you gotta do is kill
everyone because the serious sam games are about killing aliens and
nothin more. My small brain could not think about any other event 
happening in a Sven Co-op map based on Egypt from Serious sam.

And Sadly, you're not Serious Sam, so you're deff gonna die
