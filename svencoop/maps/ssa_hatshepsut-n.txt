               SERIOUS SAM ALPHA HATSHEPSUT

IMPORTANT!!!1: If some parts of the campaign are laggy, i
recommend you to set r_dynamic 1, to 0

History: After cleansing the temples of Karnak, you
received a call in wich you were informed that Mental's
cloned soldier were assigned with the mission to plant
a big ass bomb inside the Hatshepsut's Mortary Temple
(wich is used as a giant warehouse for storing weapons and ammo,
because yeah fuck this place's history let's use it as a military
checkpoint.)


This mission is simple too, kill everyone just like in the old days,
because the people that were supossed to protect the temple got
absolutely cooked and were useless, they didn't do anything to stop them.
So you and your team are the ones that are going to save the day, or the
night, by killing every single bit of ressistance found within the temple
and defuse the nuke too.

Sadly, you're not Serious Sam, meaning that you're not invincible.
